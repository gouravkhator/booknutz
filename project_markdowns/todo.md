# Todo and Issues Tracker

## Current Issues to Solve

- [ ] Upgrade the dependencies and remove the deprecated methods from the codes.
- [ ] Check why the send mail button is not getting disabled for 3 mins, and resolve the bug.

## Todo

- [ ] Upgrade the heroku stack from existing **Heroku-18** stack, as the existing one would be deprecated from `April 30th, 2023`.
- [ ] Convert all css to sass/scss, so atleast the whole css will be 1 single file, and there won't be 4 different requests for the same.
- [ ] Replace session-based auth with JWT authentication
- [ ] Add forgot password feature
  - I know that this feature should be the must, but due to time constraints, it is kept on hold for now. If I get time to add this in future, I will surely do it..
- [ ] Automatic promote http to https
